Math Game

This is a simple Java application that challenges players to get as close as possible to a target number by performing mathematical operations on a given sequence of numbers. The game supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

How to Play

Launch the application by running the MathGame.java file.
You will be presented with a target number and a sequence of numbers.
Using the available numbers and the supported operations, perform calculations to reach a result as close to the target number as possible.
Enter your calculation as a valid mathematical expression when prompted by the application.
Example: 3 * 7 + 2 / 4 - 5
Press Enter to submit your answer.
The application will evaluate your expression and display the result.
Keep playing to improve your score and get closer to the target number.
Game Rules

You can use the following operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponents (^).
You can use parentheses to control the order of operations.
The game aims to find the closest result to the target number. If multiple answers yield the same distance from the target, the application will accept any of them as correct.
To exit the game, enter "exit" or press Ctrl+C.
Scoring

The game calculates a score based on how close your result is to the target number. The lower the score, the better. The scoring formula is as follows:
score = abs(target - result)
The score represents the absolute difference between the target number and your calculated result.
The goal is to achieve the lowest possible score by making calculations that are as close to the target number as possible.
Good luck and have fun playing the Math Game!
